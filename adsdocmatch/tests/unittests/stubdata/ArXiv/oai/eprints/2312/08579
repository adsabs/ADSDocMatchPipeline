 <dc:description>  The automatic identification of planetary feature names in astronomy
publications presents numerous challenges. These features include craters,
defined as roughly circular depressions resulting from impact or volcanic
activity; dorsas, which are elongate raised structures or wrinkle ridges; and
lacus, small irregular patches of dark, smooth material on the Moon, referred
to as &quot;lake&quot; (Planetary Names Working Group, n.d.). Many feature names overlap
with places or people's names that they are named after, for example, Syria,
Tempe, Einstein, and Sagan, to name a few (U.S. Geological Survey, n.d.). Some
feature names have been used in many contexts, for instance, Apollo, which can
refer to mission, program, sample, astronaut, seismic, seismometers, core, era,
data, collection, instrument, and station, in addition to the crater on the
Moon. Some feature names can appear in the text as adjectives, like the lunar
craters Black, Green, and White. Some feature names in other contexts serve as
directions, like craters West and South on the Moon. Additionally, some
features share identical names across different celestial bodies, requiring
disambiguation, such as the Adams crater, which exists on both the Moon and
Mars. We present a multi-step pipeline combining rule-based filtering,
statistical relevance analysis, part-of-speech (POS) tagging, named entity
recognition (NER) model, hybrid keyword harvesting, knowledge graph (KG)
matching, and inference with a locally installed large language model (LLM) to
reliably identify planetary names despite these challenges. When evaluated on a
dataset of astronomy papers from the Astrophysics Data System (ADS), this
methodology achieves an F1-score over 0.97 in disambiguating planetary feature
names.
