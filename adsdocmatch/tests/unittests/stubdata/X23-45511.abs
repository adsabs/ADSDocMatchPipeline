                               Abstract
The automatic identification of planetary feature names in astronomy
publications presents numerous challenges. These features include
craters, defined as roughly circular depressions resulting from impact
or volcanic activity; dorsas, which are elongate raised structures or
wrinkle ridges; and lacus, small irregular patches of dark, smooth
material on the Moon, referred to as "lake" (Planetary Names Working
Group, n.d.). Many feature names overlap with places or people's names
that they are named after, for example, Syria, Tempe, Einstein, and
Sagan, to name a few (U.S. Geological Survey, n.d.). Some feature names
have been used in many contexts, for instance, Apollo, which can refer
to mission, program, sample, astronaut, seismic, seismometers, core,
era, data, collection, instrument, and station, in addition to the
crater on the Moon. Some feature names can appear in the text as
adjectives, like the lunar craters Black, Green, and White. Some feature
names in other contexts serve as directions, like craters West and South
on the Moon. Additionally, some features share identical names across
different celestial bodies, requiring disambiguation, such as the Adams
crater, which exists on both the Moon and Mars. We present a multi-step
pipeline combining rule-based filtering, statistical relevance analysis,
part-of-speech (POS) tagging, named entity recognition (NER) model,
hybrid keyword harvesting, knowledge graph (KG) matching, and inference
with a locally installed large language model (LLM) to reliably identify
planetary names despite these challenges. When evaluated on a dataset of
astronomy papers from the Astrophysics Data System (ADS), this
methodology achieves an F1-score over 0.97 in disambiguating planetary
feature names.
