                               Abstract
In this dissertation, several components of large-scale solar flows are
studied observationally: solar equatorial Rossby waves (waves of radial
vorticity), large-scale convection, and surface flows around active
regions. Maps of horizontal flows are derived from photospheric
observations by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) aboard the
Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) using two different techniques:
granulation tracking and local helioseismology. First, the
eigenfunctions of solar Rossby waves are measured from helioseismic
ring-diagram flow maps with a correlation method and a spectral
analysis. Down to $9$ Mm below the surface, the dependence of the radial
vorticity with radius $r$ is consistent with $r^{m-1}$, for a given
longitudinal wavenumber $m$. At the surface, the eigenfunctions are
complex-valued. The real part decreases away from the equator and
switches sign around $\pm 20-30^\circ$. The imaginary part is small, but
nonzero, and may be due to wave attenuation. This may have implications
for the transport of angular momentum in the latitudinal direction.
Second, we revisit previous measurements of power spectra of
longitudinal velocities near the solar surface, obtained from
time-distance and ring-diagram helioseismology. Several issues in these
past helioseismic analyses are identified and corrected. The corrections
are not sufficient to remove the discrepancy between the measurements. I
thus present new velocity power spectra from granulation tracking and
ring-diagram helioseismology. The two new measurements are close to each
other near the solar surface, and the corresponding kinetic energy
decreases with increasing spatial scale.
