                               Abstract
The separation of the connected and disconnected sea partons, which were
uncovered in the Euclidean path-integral formulation of the hadronic
tensor, is accommodated with an extended parametrization of the
nonperturbative parton distribution functions in the CT18 global
analysis. This is achieved with the help of the distinct small x
behaviors of these two sea partons and the constraint from the lattice
calculation of the ratio of the strange momentum fraction to that of the
u &macr; or d &macr; in the disconnected insertion. The whole dataset of
CT18 is used in this CT18CS fit. The impact of the recent SeaQuest data
on the d &macr;(x )-u &macr;(x ) distribution of CT18CS is also
discussed. The separate momentum fractions for the valence, the
connected sea and disconnected sea of u and d , the strange and the
gluon partons are presented at the input scale &mu; =1.3 GeV for the
first time. They can be compared term-by-term with systematic error
controlled lattice calculations.
