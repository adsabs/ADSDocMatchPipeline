                               Abstract
In this paper, we characterize the graded post-Lie algebra structures
and a class of shifting post-Lie algebra structures on the Witt algebra.
We obtain some new Lie algebras and give a class of their modules. As an
application, the homogeneous Rota-Baxter operators and a class of
non-homogeneous Rota-Baxter operators of weight $1$ on the Witt algebra
are studied.
