                               Abstract
Several controlled vocabularies have been developed and used by the
astronomical community, each designed to serve a specific need and a
specific group. The Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT) attempts to
provide a highly structured controlled vocabulary that will be relevant
and useful across the entire discipline, regardless of content or
platform. Because classifying articles and data will be the two major
functions of the UAT, we examine the UAT in comparison with the
Astronomical Subject Keywords used by major publications and the JWST
Science Keywords used by STScI&rsquo;s Astronomer&rsquo;s Proposal Tool.
