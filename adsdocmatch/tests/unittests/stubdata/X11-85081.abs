                               Abstract
Several different controlled vocabularies have been developed and used
by the astronomical community, each designed to serve a specific need
and a specific group. The Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT) attempts to
provide a highly structured controlled vocabulary that will be relevant
and useful across the entire discipline, regardless of content or
platform. As two major use cases for the UAT include classifying
articles and data, we examine the UAT in comparison with the
Astronomical Subject Keywords used by major publications and the JWST
Science Keywords used by STScI's Astronomer's Proposal Tool.
