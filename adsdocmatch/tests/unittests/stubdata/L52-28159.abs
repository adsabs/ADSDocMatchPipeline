                               Abstract
Steady improvements in ambient air quality in the US over the past
several decades have led to large public health benefits. However,
recent trends in PM2.5 concentrations, a key pollutant, have stagnated
or begun to reverse throughout much of the US. We quantify the
contribution of wildfire smoke to these trends and find that since 2016,
wildfire smoke has significantly slowed or reversed previous
improvements in average annual PM2.5 concentrations in two-thirds of US
states, eroding 23% of previous gains on average in those states
(equivalent to 3.6 years of air quality progress) and over 50% in
multiple western states. Smoke influence on trends in extreme PM2.5
concentrations is detectable by 2010, but remains concentrated primarily
in western states. Wildfire-driven increases in ambient PM2.5
concentrations are unregulated under current air pollution law, and,
absent additional intervention, wildfire's contribution to regional and
national air quality trends is likely to grow as the climate continues
to warm.
